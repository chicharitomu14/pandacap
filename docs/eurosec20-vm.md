## Image details

### Generic information

* Installed operating system: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Kernel image: `linux-image-4.4.0-130-generic`
* Last software update: 17 Feb 2020
* Login credentials: `panda:panda`
* The image has been scrubbed and compacted to reduce its size and make
  it ready for reuse in other projects.
* A [PANDA][panda] kernel profile for use with the [osi_linux][osi_linux]
  plugin is included: `ubuntu16-planb-kernelinfo.conf`

### Modifications related to PANDAcap

The image contains some modifications related to [PANDAcap][pandacap],
as listed below.

* [`recctrlu`][recctrlu] has been installed in `/usr/local/sbin`.
* [`recctrlu.sh`][recctrlu] has been installed in `/usr/local/bin`.
* `recctrlu.sh` has been hooked to `/etc/pam.d/sshd`.
  If the PANDA [`recctrl`][recctrl] plugin is active, this will trigger
  PANDA to start recording after a successful ssh login.
* `rc.local` will run `/root/usbbootstrap.sh` at boot-time.
  This will run runtime bootstrapping scripts when the image boots,
  and then clean-up after itself.

### Removing PANDAcap modifications

The PANDAcap-related modification should not affect the use of the image
for most other purposes. If needed, they can be removed as following.

```bash
sudo sed -i '/recctrlu.sh/d' /etc/pam.d/sshd
sudo rm -f /usr/local/{,s}bin/recctrlu*
sudo sed -i '/usbbootstrap.sh/d' /etc/rc.local
sudo rm /root/usbbootstrap.sh
```
